 MyApp
 MyApp is a mobile application built using Flutter that uses the MVVM architecture pattern and GetX framework for state management.
 The app uses two-way data binding to ensure that changes in the UI are immediately reflected in the data model and vice versa.
 The app includes observable properties and widgets, 
 which means that changes to these properties or widgets will trigger updates to any other widgets that are observing them.
 The app also uses GetX for efficient and effective state management. This framework allows for reactive programming, 
 which means that changes to the state of the app will automatically update the UI without the need for manual intervention.


 In addition to these features, the app also includes all of the features mentioned in the previous description:

 *API calls: Uses API calls to retrieve and display data in the app.
 *Firebase FCM: Provides push notifications to users.
 *PDF generation: Allows users to generate and view PDF files, as well as store PDF files locally.
 *Searching and multi-word searching: Allows users to search for items in the list and search for multiple words at once.
 *Date selection: Allows users to select a date from a calendar and view a list of items specific to that date.
 *State change: Allows users to change the state of an item in the list.
 *Image display: Displays images from binary data.
 *Optimized list: Can handle over 20,000 objects in a list and maintains smooth performance.
 *Remember ID and password: Allows users to save their login credentials for future use.


 Screens
 The app consists of five screens:

 *Login screen: Allows users to log in to the app using their username and password.
 *Company screen: Displays information about the user's company.
 *Drawer: Provides access to various screens in the app.
 *Account ledger: Displays the user's account information, including their balance and transaction history.
